# How to optimize code in GPU
This is a series of GPU optimization topics. Here we will introduce in detail how to optimize the program on the GPU. The reduce optimization has been completed. The optimization of GEMM has completed the CUDA C code. The assembler is currently being used to tune the code, and the code will be issued later.
